DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database_name
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```
*Note: The server will automatically create the necessary tables on startup.*

Start the server (with auto-reload):
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal, navigate to the client directory, and install dependencies.
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `client/` (optional for local, defaults to localhost:3000):
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Start the client:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.
